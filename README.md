# QRS: The Geometric Unified Theory of Matter (5D Optics)

> **"What if Refraction is just Geometry?"**

**Status:** Final Scientific Release (Version 3.0)  
**Date:** January 03, 2026  
**Subject:** Theoretical Physics / Condensed Matter / 5D Kaluza-Klein

## 🌌 The Big Idea

This project provides the computational proof that **optical refraction ($n$)** is identical to a scalar field gradient in a compact 5th dimension ($n = 1/\Phi$). By identifying the refractive index as a geometric property of spacetime, we unify **General Relativity**, **Electrodynamics**, and **Quantum Mechanics** into a single Effective Field Theory (EFT).

### Key Discovery: The Fundamental Identity

$$n(x) = \frac{1}{\Phi(x)}$$
*Where $\Phi$ is the local size of the 5th dimension ($S^1$ radius).*

## ⚠️ Scientific Note

This research suggests that the historical **Kaluza-Klein theory** did not fail—it was simply misapplied to the vacuum. When applied to **condensed matter**, the 5th dimension becomes a physical reality with a measurable radius ($R \approx 0.86$ nm), as proven by the resonant coupling $\chi \propto \Phi^{-5}$.
